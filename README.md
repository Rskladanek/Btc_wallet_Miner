Bitcoin Wallet Key Scraper

This Python script is an experimental application that generates random Bitcoin wallet keys and checks their balance using the blockchain.info API.
Description

The code generates a new Bitcoin private key (a random 32-byte number), computes the corresponding public key and Bitcoin address, then queries the balance of this address using the blockchain.info API. The results are logged to a file if a non-zero balance is found.

Please note that this is not an effective or efficient method for Bitcoin mining or wallet hacking. The Bitcoin address space is astronomically large, so the chance of generating a key with a non-zero balance is practically zero.
Features

    Generates Bitcoin private and public keys
    Checks the balance of the generated keys using the blockchain.info API
    Logs keys with non-zero balance to a file

Usage

    Install the required Python libraries with pip:

pip install ecdsa requests base58

    Run the script:

python3 bitcoin_wallet_generator.py

    The program will continuously generate new keys and check their balances, sleeping for 60 seconds between each check. If a key with a non-zero balance is found, it will be logged to a file.

    Press Ctrl+C to stop the program.
